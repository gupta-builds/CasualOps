// Per-step detection evidence hints for the adversarial preview.
// For each MITRE technique we surface:
//   - confirm:  telemetry signals that, if present, would CONFIRM the step happened
//   - falsify:  observations that, if absent or contradicted, would FALSIFY the
//               hypothesis that this step is occurring (i.e. rule it out)
//   - source:   the primary log/data source an analyst would pivot into
//
// Heuristic: technique-specific overrides take precedence; otherwise we fall back
// to a tactic-level default. This is intentionally client-side and curated so it
// reads credibly to a senior security audience without backend calls.
