      "Coordinated spear-phishing campaign targeting the finance department over the past 72h. Spoofed vendor invoice emails with malicious .docm attachments leveraging CVE-style macro execution. Two finance analysts opened attachments; one entered SSO credentials on a lookalike portal. Suspected lateral movement via stolen Okta session cookies. Need to: contain identity compromise, decide whether to force-rotate all SSO sessions tonight, balance disruption vs. exposure. Constraint: quarterly close in progress, leadership wants minimum business impact.",

EDR shows lsass dumping ~36h ago, DC enumeration, and SMB writes to 12 file servers. No exfil confirmed yet. Backups exist (offline, 24h RPO) but restoration window unknown.

Activity outside normal hours, used personal cloud sync client briefly before being blocked. Legal flagged competitor as likely destination.

We pin to ^1.x but CI auto-bumped on a feature branch yesterday; build artifacts may have shipped to staging. No production deploy yet.

CDN absorbing 70%, origin saturating. Suspected extortion precursor (no demand yet). Decide: tighten WAF rules vs. accept false positives on real customers, enable CAPTCHA on checkout (revenue impact), engage upstream scrubbing provider (cost), or ride it out.
