# HiveMind

**An evidence-backed causal reasoning engine for cyber operations.**

HiveMind turns a messy incident prompt into a structured investigation: agents
decompose the problem, write decision memos, propose a causal graph, compile
external evidence into observations, and only then estimate intervention impact
with DoWhy and statsmodels.

The important design choice is simple:

> The LLM proposes hypotheses. Evidence decides whether an ATE is allowed to
> exist.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most agent demos stop at a confident narrative. HiveMind is built to survive the
obvious engineering objection: "Where did the data come from?"

| Layer | What it does | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orchestrator | Splits an incident into 2-3 investigation tracks | Standardized tier scoring |
| Parent agents | Spawn focused child investigators | Explicit objectives per branch |
| Child agents | Produce decision memos | Assumptions, risks, evidence needs |
| Evaluator | Ranks memos against task priorities | Structured scores and final recommendation |
| Causal architect | Proposes a DAG and measurement plan | No dataset-row generation |
| Evidence compiler | Converts SIEM/CVE/report records into numeric rows | Provenance, missingness, balance gates |
| Estimator | Runs DoWhy, statsmodels, and refuters | ATE withheld when data is weak |

## Answering The Hard Questions

### 1. Where does DoWhy data come from?

DoWhy runs on the dataframe produced by `dataset_compiler.py`. That dataframe is
compiled from normalized `EvidenceRecord` objects, not from LLM-generated rows.
Each compiled row keeps source provenance:

- `source_type`: `siem`, `edr`, `cve`, `incident_report`, `asset_inventory`, or
  `manual`
- `source_name`: concrete export/feed/index name
- `raw_ref`: pointer to the original record
- `asset_id` and `observed_at`: row-level traceability

### 2. Is the LLM confirming its own story?

No. The LLM is restricted to graph and measurement-plan generation. Synthetic
records are skipped by the compiler and cannot pass the empirical-data gate.
If real evidence is missing, the estimator returns:

```text
method = withheld:data_quality_gates
ate = null
p_value = null
```

### 3. Is this connected to real data sources?

The API now supports export-based normalization for:

- `POST /normalize/sentinel` for Microsoft Sentinel or SIEM-like rows
- `POST /normalize/cve` for NVD/CVE feed records
- `POST /normalize/incidents` for incident report exports

The current demo does not require live tenant credentials. It accepts exported
records, normalizes them into the shared evidence schema, and sends them through
the same causal compiler used by `/estimate` and `/run`.

### 4. How many rows does DoWhy need, and why 50?

HiveMind treats 50 complete treatment/outcome observations as a minimum smoke
gate, not as a universal statistical guarantee. The estimator also requires at
least 10 treated and 10 control rows, observed variation in treatment/outcome,
and acceptable covariate missingness. The report warns that 200+ rows are
recommended for a more stable estimate.

Below the gate, ATE is withheld. Above the gate, the report still exposes
`n_rows`, treatment/control counts, missingness, warnings, p-value, confidence
interval, and refuter results so reviewers can judge strength.

### 5. Where is the p-value computed?

The p-value is computed in `estimators.py` with `statsmodels.OLS` against the
treatment coefficient, using the same treatment/outcome/adjustment set that
DoWhy estimates. It is not hard-coded.

### 6. Is there a standardized metric for agent tiers?

Yes. `benchmarking.py` emits deterministic tier metrics for:

- orchestrator decomposition
- parent-agent child task quality
- child memo completeness
- evaluator output shape
- causal graph validity
- estimator readiness

The final artifact includes `agent_tier_metrics.overall_score` and per-tier
observed signals.

### 7. How does the LLM know which confounders to suggest for the DAG?

The Causal Architect performs a Semantic Intersection between the incident prompt and the available telemetry schema. It proposes candidate confounders (e.g., Asset_Criticality) which are then validated by the Evidence Normalizer. If the variable exists in the physical logs, it stays; if it's a hallucination, the Gatekeeper prunes the edge before estimation.

## Run It

Create a root `.env` file:

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-08-01-preview
```

With Docker Compose, Kafka is enabled automatically via Redpanda:

```env
# Set only when running the API outside Compose (Compose uses redpanda:9092)
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP=localhost:19092
```

Topics: `hivemind.runs`, `hivemind.spawn`, `hivemind.artifacts`, `hivemind.telemetry`.

Live UI progress uses SSE. The frontend generates a `run_id`, opens
`GET /run/{run_id}/events`, then calls `POST /run` with the same id. If
`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP` is unset, the graph still runs but the event stream is empty.

See [ARCH.md](ARCH.md) for bus design decisions.

Start the full stack:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Open:

- Frontend: <http://localhost:8080>
- API docs: <http://localhost:8000/docs>
- Health check: <http://localhost:8000/health>

Stop it:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Fast Demo Without LLM Tokens

Run the deterministic evidence-backed demo:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/demo/estimate
```

That endpoint uses a fixed SIEM-style evidence fixture for:

- treatment: `Patch_Applied`
- outcome: `Lateral_Movement`
- confounder: `Asset_Criticality`

It exercises the same compiler, data gates, DoWhy estimator, statsmodels
p-value/CI reporting, and refuters used by real evidence.

---

## Estimate From Your Own Evidence

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/estimate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "graph": {
      "nodes": [
        {"id": "Patch_Applied", "label": "Patch Applied", "description": "Asset patched before the observation window"},
        {"id": "Lateral_Movement", "label": "Lateral Movement", "description": "Lateral movement observed after exposure"},
        {"id": "Asset_Criticality", "label": "Asset Criticality", "description": "High-value asset tier"}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"source": "Asset_Criticality", "target": "Patch_Applied", "relationship": "Critical assets are prioritized"},
        {"source": "Asset_Criticality", "target": "Lateral_Movement", "relationship": "Critical assets attract more movement"},
        {"source": "Patch_Applied", "target": "Lateral_Movement", "relationship": "Patching reduces exploitability"}
      ],
      "treatment_variable": "Patch_Applied",
      "outcome_variable": "Lateral_Movement",
      "candidate_confounders": ["Asset_Criticality"]
    },
    "evidence_records": [
      {
        "source_type": "siem",
        "source_name": "sentinel-kql-export",
        "observed_at": "2026-05-12T10:00:00Z",
        "asset_id": "host-001",
        "raw_ref": "row-001",
        "extracted_fields": {
          "Patch_Applied": 1,
          "Lateral_Movement": 0,
          "Asset_Criticality": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

With only one row, this returns an explicit data-quality refusal instead of a
fake causal result. That is the point.

## Future Enhancements

- **Production-Grade MCP Intelligence Fabric:** Build a distributed MCP client layer capable of dynamically discovering, authenticating, and routing across agentic topics within the swarm. Agents will interface with specialized cyber-oriented MCP servers providing contextual memory, threat intelligence enrichment, tool orchestration, policy enforcement, and reasoning augmentation. The long-term goal is a zero-trust, latency-aware intelligence plane for autonomous multi-agent coordination.
- **Deep Hierarchical Agent Expansion:** Introduce additional recursive child-agent layers with adaptive spawning policies driven by task complexity, uncertainty, and resource availability. Runtime efficiency will be improved through asynchronous execution pipelines, speculative parallel reasoning, and distributed workload scheduling across heterogeneous compute environments.
- **Kafka-Native Agent Communication Backbone:** Implement a dedicated high-throughput Kafka event bus to support scalable inter-agent communication, artifact propagation, and state synchronization across the swarm. Agents will publish structured semantic artifacts representing hypotheses, observations, plans, and intermediate reasoning outputs, enabling emergent collaboration patterns and distributed cognition across the hierarchy. As we spawn more child agents, a local LangGraph state will eventually become too heavy; offloading the "Semantic Artifacts" to a message bus is the only way to achieve "Evolutionary Compute".
- **5D Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph Engine:** Develop a real-time 5D spatiotemporal graph system continuously updated from Kafka event streams. The graph will model entities, relationships, temporal evolution, and contextual state transitions across the swarm. Dynamically generated DAGs and causal inference pipelines will emerge directly from this evolving graph substrate, enabling temporally-aware reasoning, anomaly tracing, and adaptive decision intelligence.
- **Evolutionary Agent Optimization Framework:** Integrate a steady-state evolutionary algorithm for autonomous optimization of agent spawning strategies, behavioral policies, and orchestration patterns. Agents will inherit successful traits through mutation and crossover mechanisms, allowing the swarm to continuously evolve more efficient reasoning pathways, coordination structures, and task-specialized behaviors over time.
- **Federated Multi-Swarm Coordination:** Extend the architecture toward federated swarm interoperability, where independent agent clusters can exchange semantic state, negotiate objectives, and collaboratively solve large-scale problems while preserving localized autonomy and fault isolation.
- **Adaptive Trust, Reputation, and Reliability Layer:** Implement a reputation-driven trust framework inspired by distributed systems and service mesh architectures. Agents, tools, and MCP servers will be continuously evaluated using latency, correctness, consistency, and semantic reliability metrics, enabling dynamic routing, circuit-breaking, and failure containment across the orchestration graph.
- **Real-Time Causal Reasoning Infrastructure:** Expand the DAG generation pipeline into a streaming causal inference engine capable of constructing and updating probabilistic causal models from live swarm telemetry. This will enable agents to move beyond correlation-based reasoning toward intervention-aware strategic planning and root-cause analysis.
- **Autonomous Resource Governance:** Introduce reinforcement-learning-driven resource allocation for GPU scheduling, agent quotas, memory utilization, and orchestration depth. The system will dynamically balance exploration vs. exploitation while preventing uncontrolled swarm expansion or infrastructure saturation.
- **Persistent Semantic Memory and Retrieval Layer:** Develop a hybrid long-term memory architecture combining vector retrieval, graph traversal, and temporal indexing. Agents will maintain persistent contextual awareness across tasks, enabling longitudinal reasoning, adaptive learning, and higher-order strategic coordination over time.
